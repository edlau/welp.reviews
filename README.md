To get started, make sure you have Ruby 2.3 or higher and the `bundler` gem installed. Then:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Run `bundle exec rails db:setup`.
4. Run `bundle exec rails server`.
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`

That's it! Start out by playing with the queries in the `app/graphql/queries/` directory and take it from there.
